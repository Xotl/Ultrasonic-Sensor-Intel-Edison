Interfacing an ultrasonic sensor with the Intel Edison

## Schematic
![Schematic](/Schematic/Schematic_esquema.jpg "Schematic")

Some notes to consider while looking at the above schematic:
* U1 & U2 are 4N25 optocouplers and NOT 4N35.
* The ultrasonic sensor used is the HC-SR04.
* The Intel Edison pins are from the mini breakout board.

*NOTE: Still work in progress*
